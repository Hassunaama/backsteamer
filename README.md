# Backsteamer
An tool that allows Steam games to boot from the executable without the Steam API

## Installing / Using

### Windows installation
First, you need to have:
 - Windows 10 or later
 - A Steam game installed

Then, go to [this](https://github.com/Hassunaama/backsteamer/releases/latest) page, and download the installer file.
After that, run the installer. The installer should install the program.

When you run the program, it asks for a game path. Input your game path for the game you want to play, and press "Continue".
After that, it patches the game, and creates a new, fake steam_api.dll / steam_api64.dll and a backup of the old ones.

You can now launch the game from the executable (completely offline), or from Backsteamer (partially online[*](online.md))
